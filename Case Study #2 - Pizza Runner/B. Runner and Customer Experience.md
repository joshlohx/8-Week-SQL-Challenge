- On average, a single pizza order takes 12 minutes to prepare.
- An order with 3 pizzas takes 30 minutes at an average of 10 minutes per pizza.
- It takes 16 minutes to prepare an order with 2 pizzas which is 8 minutes per pizza — making 2 pizzas in a single order the ultimate efficiency rate.

_(Assuming that distance is calculated from Pizza Runner HQ to customer’s place)_

- Customer 104 stays the nearest to Pizza Runner HQ at average distance of 10km, whereas Customer 105 stays the furthest at 25km.

### 5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

Firstly, I'm going to filter results with non-null duration first just to have a feel. You can skip this step and go straight to the answer.

- The difference between longest (40 minutes) and shortest (10 minutes) delivery time for all orders is 30 minutes.

### 6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

````sql

````

**Answer:**

![image]()

_(Average speed = Distance in km / Duration in hour)_
- Runner 1’s average speed runs from 37.5km/h to 60km/h.
- Runner 2’s average speed runs from 35.1km/h to 93.6km/h. Danny should investigate Runner 2 as the average speed has a 300% fluctuation rate!
- Runner 3’s average speed is 40km/h

### 7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

````sql

````

**Answer:**

![image]()

- Runner 1 has 100% successful delivery.
- Runner 2 has 75% successful delivery.
- Runner 3 has 50% successful delivery

_(It’s not right to attribute successful delivery to runners as order cancellations are out of the runner’s control.)_
